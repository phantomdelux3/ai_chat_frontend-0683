User opens the app and sees a welcome message\n2. User types what they're looking for (e.g., "I need posters and my budget is 3000")\n3. The message is sent to your external API via the proxy routes\n4. The AI responds with text and product recommendations\n5. Products are displayed in beautiful cards below the message\n6. Session persists so users can continue their conversation\n\nThe app is fully type-safe, passes all TypeScript checks, and follows all the project guidelines!\n
